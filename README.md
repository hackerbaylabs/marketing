We invest in bold technology businesses focussed on profitability and sustainability over reckless and mindless growth.

We won't force you to flip your business in 3-5 years. We won't lock you into golden handcuffs or push complex deal terms. We won't ruin your life with weeks of unnecessary due diligence. We won't renegotiate and grind you on terms and we don't take a board seat.

We'll make an offer within 7 days and close in 30. We wire you the funds the day we sign the contract. We started HackerBay Ventures to create an investor we wished we had when we started up.
