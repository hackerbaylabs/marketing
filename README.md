### Description (500 characters)
We invest in bold technology businesses focussed on profitability and sustainability over reckless and mindless growth. We typically look for early stage technology or technology-enabled businesses that have been in operations for at least a year or more, have a little revenue (minimum $10k, ideally $20K, as high as $100K anually), and have a high quality team in place.

## Differentiators

We won't force you to flip your business in 3-5 years. We won't lock you into golden handcuffs or push complex deal terms. We won't ruin your life with weeks of unnecessary due diligence. We won't renegotiate and grind you on terms and we don't take a board seat.

We'll make an offer within 7 days and close in 30. We wire you the funds the day we sign the contract. We started HackerBay Ventures to create an investor we wished we had when we started up. 

We usually sign a [SAFE](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/#safe) at this stage of the business - it's fair to both founders and us when critical valuation conversations are deferred to a priced round.

## Who do we invest in?

**SaaS**

You've got your subscription product off the ground and have few paying customers who are using it. You're making some revenue a year and you need more funds to hire people and scale. We usually like companies that can demonstrate unit economics, path to profitability, high margins and a great team.

**Enterprise Software**

We have significant experience building enterprise software and selling them. Software used by large companies is still awful and still very lucrative and there's a lot of room for software automation and innovation in every industry. Every vertical is going through some form of information-based disruption; this is causing businesses to modernize their practices, leveraging new data, accelerating key processes, and delivering digitally-enabled experiences in the process.

**Developer Tools**

The products software developers use to make software are a powerful lever: they have a dramatic impact on the quality and kind of software being built. Weâ€™re interested in helping developers create better software, faster. This includes new ways to write, understand, and collaborate on code, and the next generation of tools and infrastructure for delivering software continuously and reliably. Good way to think about this - What comes after programming languages and frameworks?
